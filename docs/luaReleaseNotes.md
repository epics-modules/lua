lua Release Notes
=================

Release 3-0-2
-------------

- Various bug fixes relating to proper link handling
- Fixed another windows build issue relating to order of includes
- Enum input field support added, fields are grabbed as string value.


Release 3-0-1
-------------

-  Fix issues for windows builds.


Release 3-0
-----------

-  Lua language version updated to 5.4.0
-  "db" library added. Allows users to generate records within lua scripts
   during IOC startup.
-  luaPortDriver added. Generates an asynPortDriver based off of a lua
   script. Each parameter is defined within lua and links to a snippet
   of lua code, with the code being run whenever the parameter is read
   or written (depending on how the parameter is defined).
-  Named lua states added. Can create lua_States that can be shared between
   instances of lua scripts by name.
-  The command exit in the lua shell changed from a specially recognized
   word to a lua function so that it can be properly parsed within a chunk.
   Allows it to be used in a conditional or loop.
-  luascriptRecord AA-JJ inputs can now take in arrays and the record can
   also write out to array records.
-  luaShell.h API changed, luashBegin renamed to luashLoad to match IOC shell
   naming conventions, C++ overloads of luash command to allow for lua_States
   to be given to shell to set the environment.
-  Added functions to luaEpics.h to provide scoped environment variables,
   changed luaLoadMacros to use scopes.
-  Fixed an issue with too many temp files being created and deleted by the
   iocsh library.


Release 2-1
-----------

-  LUA_SCRIPT_PATH now always includes the current directory. Makes more
   sense when using '<' in the lua shell.
-  Previously, the "iocsh" library was used only to lookup ioc shell functions,
   now it will now also check for environment variables that match the given name.
-  "iocsh" library lookups now also fixed to return nil when it can't find a
   matching element (in R2-0 it was returning functions that, when called, stated
   nothing was found).
-  Added setOption function to the "asyn" library. works the same way as
   asynSetOption. The asyn.client class received a matching function.
-  Fixed bug in "asyn" library where writeread requests were attempting to read
   twice, causing timeout waits.
-  Added luashCmd function to ioc shell. Useful for running one-liners of lua code.
-  lua shell now specially recognizes the line '#ENABLE_HASH_COMMENTS',
   when put into a lua shell script, the shell will ignore lines where
   the first non-whitespace line is a '#' character. Allowing scripts to
   appear more like regular ioc shell scripts.
-  lua shell now ignores leading whitespace on lines, was only an issue
   with the 'exit' and '<' commands.
-  Fixed an issue where I was leaving a metatable reference on the lua
   stack when luaCreateState was called.
-  Documentation has been switched to use ReStructured text, now hosted
   on https://epics-lua.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Release 2-0
-----------

-  "iocsh" library now available for any version of base
-  Calls to the "iocsh" library can omit the library name while within
   the luash interpreter, this makes the luash almost fully backwards
   compatible with iocsh scripts. The only problems come from comments
   (due to "#" being a command in lua) and macros being different than
   global variables.
-  Better error handling in "asyn" library
-  lua Script file location now allows full paths
-  loadRegistered function automatically triggered and no longer needed
   for lua startup scripts
-  Lua static library registration now setup to work with standard lua
   "require" functionality
-  'asyn' lua library function "port" changed to "client" to better
   represent that it is creating an asynOctetClient not an
   asynPortDriver. InTerminator and OutTerminator changed to member
   fields rather than get/set functions.
-  'asyn' lua library new function "driver" creates an object
   representing an asynPortDriver. Allows you to get/set the value of
   parameters in the paramList and trigger the read and write functions
   of parameters.
-  Parameters supplied in luaRecord CODE field and macros provided to
   luaSpawn are now evaluated using a lua sandbox environment rather
   than a custom parser.
