===================
IOC Shell Functions
===================

**iocsh.** <item> [(*argumentsâ€¦*)]

::

   Performs an environment check for the given item. First, the user's environment is
   checked to see if there are any environment variables that match up with the item's
   name. If there aren't, the search then drops back to trying to find a matching
   ioc shell function. Only functions that are registered in the iocsh function database
   will be found. If there are no matching elements in either of these two locations,
   a nil will be returned.

   When using the lua shell interpreter, this functionality is embedded into the global
   environment. Any attempt to reference a name that hasn't been set as a lua variable
   will attempt a search to see if the name references an environment variable or iocsh
   function. These are, however, read-only accesses. If you attempt to set a given
   item name to a value, all you will do is create a new lua variable with the given
   value.

   arguments   [varies] - If you are referencing an ioc shell function, these are the
                          arguments that will get sent to the function. Since function
                          references can be passed around, parentheses are necessary to
                          actually invoke the function.
